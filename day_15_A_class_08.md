## Homework for Avi

- [x] Q: If best-fit memory lists are ordered by size from smallest to largest, why would we need to review all memory blocks before allocation? Couldn't we just allocate to the first block that fits? A: Best-fit memory lists are NOT ordered by size, they are ordered by address. 
- [x] Q: In the best fit policy, what happens concretely when two blocks of equal size are found to be acceptable? A: It depends on the OS and policy implementation.
- [x] Q: In the best fit policy, is further searching necessary if the block size and the job size are found to be identical? A: It shouldn't be necessary to further search, no.
- [ ] Q: Do memory allocation schemes strictly use only 1 memory allocation policy, or, can some schemes use more than 1 policy, depending on factors/circumstances? (see slide 14, is it simultaneous, situational, or something else? on which different policies can be used)
- [ ] Does the best-fit policy also use 2 lists (free and busy) or does it only use a free list?
