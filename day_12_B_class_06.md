## Homework for Avi

- [x] Why is it that when taking out a bootable USB stick sometimes weird things happen and the computer cannot gracefully recover? A: (1) Sometimes the OS might still be reading/writing from/to the USB. (2) The file system could get corrupted, causing errors the OS can't recover from. (3) The bootloader may hang or crash if the OS is relying on resources stored on the USB. (4) Some OS environments use the USB for virtual memory (swap space), which, if the USB is removed, the OS might not know how to recover. (5) Some USB controllers don't handle sudden disconnections well. 
- [x] Q: First programmer? Ada Lovelace? A: Yes, she wrote her algorithms in the 1940s and not in a modern day programming language, but rather, an algorithm, that calculated Bernouli numbers.
- [x] Q: First programming language designer? Grace Hopper? A: Grace Hopper made the first compiler for COBOL. COBOL itself was made by a committee led by Grace Hopper.
- [x] Q: Who wrote the earliest Assembly languages and when? A: Maurice Wilkes, F.C. Williams, and Tom Kilburn wrote some of the earliest Assembly languages in the 1940s and 1950s.
- [x] Q: Is ROM considered part of main memory? A: Yes, both ROM and RAM are part of main memory.
    > Definition: Main memory refers to the memory that the CPU can access directly for storing data and instructions currently being used by the computer. 
    > Types of main memory: The two primary types of main memory are RAM and ROM. 
    > Functionality: While RAM is used for temporary data storage that can be read and written to, ROM stores permanent data that can only be read, typically including the system BIOS needed to start up the computer.
