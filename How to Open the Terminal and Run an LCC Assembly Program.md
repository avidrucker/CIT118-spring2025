# How to Open the Terminal and Run an LCC.js Assembly Program

1. Open the terminal from the start menu or search bar

2. Navigate in the terminal using `cd Documents` and then `cd lccjs` to the C:/Users/YourName/Documents/lccjs directory

3. Run the command `node ./src/core/lcc./js PROGRAM_NAME.a` to run your program (replace `PROGRAM_NAME` with the name of your assembly  program)

Note: You may need to run the `fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression` in the terminal again to reactivate node access
